For each problem, the matrix can be modified as needed.

Question 1:
Gaussian Elimination and Backward Substitution
This section performs Gaussian elimination to solve a system of linear equations. It also applies backward substitution to find the solution vector.

Question 2:
This section performs LU factorization of a given matrix and computes its determinant.

Question 3:
This section checks if a given matrix is diagonally dominant. 

Question 4:
This section checks whether a given matrix is positive definite by calculating its eigenvalues.
